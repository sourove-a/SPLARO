# Legacy Deployment Mirror

This directory is kept as a Hostinger deployment mirror for backward compatibility.

Primary development sources are:
- `public/api/` (PHP API source)
- `components/`, `App.tsx`, `store.tsx` (React app)
- `app/api/` (Next.js modular APIs)

If you do not deploy through Hostinger file mirroring, treat this folder as legacy/reference.
